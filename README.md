RobotMaze Browser Game 

In order to learn JavaScript I created a RobotMaze Browser Game. I followed a tutorial from TreeHouse learning. Note I did NOT create the visual interface for the program, but did complete the rest (maze/robot logic etc.). 

To play the game: 
* Clone/download this repository.
* Open index.html in the root folder with Chrome (or your other favorite browser). 
* Place your robot in the maze.
* Get to the finish!

Make your own maze:
The index.html file is setup in such a way that lets you easily alter the maze (size, where walls are, start/end point). Edit the script (starting on line #20) to see what sort of maze you can make!
